I used the iterators python library to find every combination of the arr for size 1 to len(arr) to find every non-empty subset, then summed up the subset and put it into an array called subsetSums

I then iterated through subsetSums and added the pow(element,k) to the answer

I was only able to solve task 1,2, and 3 for this problem as I couldn't generate the subsets fast enough, and too much resources was used so the process was killed.

I tried the code here:
https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/subset-sum-sum-of-all-subsets/
to generate the subsets but it still wasn't efficient enough.
