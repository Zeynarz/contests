I used a brute force approach to this problem

I first sorted the array, and counted out all the existing runs (that is done without using wildcards) and stored all of the runs in an array called runs
At the same time, I also counted out all the gaps between the existing runs and stored them in an array called gaps.

I then iterated through the runs array, and tried to connect runs[i] with runs[i+1:] and calculate how far I can go, by using the gaps array and the wildcard number.  If the run was longer than my current answer, the run would be my new answer.

after the loop is done, every possible run would have been done and I would get the maximum number.
