if equal distance between teachers and wall, stay still
if there is a place to run, then run

m=2,q=1
so only 2 teachers, and 1 query

u only rly need to know the 2 teachers that sandwich him right?
or only 1 teacher if he's sandwiched by the wall


1 2 3 4 5
2,2

guarenteed
b != a


1 2 3 4
2,1


1 2   3  4 5 6 7
2,4




1 2 3 ! 5




1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10


its like, finding the median between the two teachers if you're sandwiched,
and that is the end point


if you're sandwiched, best thing to do is to go to the middle
if you're at the walls, best thing to do is to run to the walls
